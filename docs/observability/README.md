# Observability
This README describes observability characteristics of the Fleet Manager

## Metrics
The file [metrics.go](../../pkg/metrics/metrics.go) creates Prometheus metrics
of differing types. These are the metrics which are then reported and visualised
in each Grafana dashboard.
See [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/) for more info
about Prometheus metric types.

These metrics are grouped by metric subject: data plane clusters,
service ('kafka') and reconcilers.

There is also a section of metrics regarding the Observatorium service.

The file [metrics_middleware.go](../../pkg/handlers/metrics_middleware.go)
creates metrics concerned with incoming requests to the Fleet Manager API. This
file contains information about how these metrics are written and reported.

## Grafana Dashboards
See the [Getting Started](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/?pg=docs)
section of the Grafana website for general information about Grafana and its
uses.

See the [JSON Model](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/json-model/?pg=docs)
section for more info about Grafana Dashboard JSON models

## Further information
See [SLOs README](../slos/README.md) for more informtion about metrics and
their use in measuring SLIs.

## Observatorium

The service that the Fleet Manager manages
can send metrics to a [Observatorium](https://github.com/observatorium/observatorium)
instance from the data plane. Fleet Manager is also able to interact directly
with Observatorium to retrieve the metrics sent by the managed
service from the data plane.

### Configuring Observatorium

To configure KAS Fleet Manager to use Observatorium, a Red Hat managed
Observatorium service can be used. For that, a new `Observatorium Tenant` has
to be created and configured in that Red Hat managed Observatorium service if
there isn't one already. That task is done by the Red Hat Observability team.
To do so there's an Onboarding process. See the[Onboarding a Tenant into Red Hatâ€™s Observatorium Instance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjM9RRvij-IgwqQMt5q798B_4k4A9Y16uT2oV9sxN3g) document on how to do it.

If you have any doubts about the onboarding process, The Red Hat Observability
team can be contacted on the #forum-observatorium Slack channel.

## Observability stack

When a data plane cluster is created/assigned in Fleet Manager, the
*Observability stack* is installed as part of the [cluster
Terraforming process](../implementation.md).

The Observability stack includes:
* [Observability Operator](https://github.com/redhat-developer/observability-operator): The
  Observability Operator deploys & maintains a common platform for Application
  Services to share and utilize to aid in monitoring & reporting on their
  service components. It integrates with the [Observatorium](#observatorium)
  project for pushing metrics and logs to a central location. See the linked
  repository on details about what is deployed / configured by the operator
* Configuration to set up the Observability stack through Observability
  Operator. This configuration is done by hosting a set of configuration files
  in a git remote repository that has to be provided as part of the Fleet
  Manager configuration. An example of a git remote repository containing
  the observability stack configuration in a git remote repository for the
  Managed Kafka service can be found in the [observability-resources-mk](https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/observability-resources-mk)
  git repository

To provide the parameters to set up the observability stack in fleet manager
those are set as CLI flags to the kas-fleet-manager code. See
the [Observability section in the feature-flags documentation file](../feature-flags.md#Observability)
for details.
